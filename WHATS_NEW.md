# 🆕 What's New - Spaces Feature

## Evolution: From Pantry Tracker to Universal Things Tracker

Your app has evolved! It's no longer just a pantry tracker - it's now a **universal things tracker** for your entire home and life.

## 🏠 Introducing: Spaces

**Spaces** are top-level physical locations (rooms/areas) that organize your inventory.

### What Are Spaces?

Think of spaces as:
- 🏠 **Rooms** - Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room
- 🏢 **Areas** - Office, Garage, Basement
- 📦 **Units** - Storage Unit, Outdoor Shed

### New Hierarchy

```
OLD (2 levels):
Storage → Item

NEW (3 levels):
Space → Storage → Item
```

**Example:**
```
Space: "Master Bedroom" (type: bedroom)
  └── Storage: "Walk-in Closet"
      └── Item: "Dress Shirts" (8 pieces)
  └── Storage: "Dresser"
      └── Item: "White Socks" (12 pairs)
```

## 🔄 Migration from Old Structure

### Backward Compatible!

Storages can still exist without spaces:
- ✅ **With Space:** `Storage(name: "Pantry", space_id: 1)`
- ✅ **Without Space:** `Storage(name: "Misc Box")` (legacy support)

### Adding Spaces to Existing Storages

```bash
# 1. Create a space
curl -X POST /api/v1/spaces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"space":{"name":"Kitchen","space_type":"kitchen"}}'

# 2. Update existing storage to add space
curl -X PATCH /api/v1/storages/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"storage":{"space_id":1}}'
```

---

## 📝 Updated Storage Response

Storage JSON now includes space information:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Pantry",
  "description": "Main pantry",
  "space_id": 1,           // 🆕 NEW!
  "space_name": "Kitchen", // 🆕 NEW!
  "parent_id": null,
  "children_count": 0,
  "items_count": 15,
  "created_at": "...",
  "updated_at": "..."
}
```
